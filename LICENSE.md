# Licensing

This repository uses a multi‑licence scheme to accommodate different types of
content. Unless otherwise noted, files fall into one of the three categories
below.

## Code

The source code and scripts (all files under `firmware/`, `tools/`, `agents/` and
most of the repository’s infrastructure) are released under the **MIT
License**. This permissive licence allows you to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of the software as long as
you include the original copyright and licence notice in all copies.

## Hardware design files

The hardware design files (e.g. KiCad projects, mechanical drawings, BOMs,
enclosure scripts) are released under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence
Version 2 – Permissive variant**. CERN developed this licence to promote
collaboration among hardware designers and to ensure the freedom to use,
study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on
those designs【572981070514051†L86-L91】.  See `licenses/CERN-OHL-PERMISSIVE.txt`
